# LocalStack Demo

Demo showing how to set up and use LocalStack alongside Testcontainers to run AWS cloud and serverless applications locally for integration testing purposes.

**NOTE: AWS SDK V1 is required as a dependency alongside AWS SDK V2, as Testcontainers LocalStack dependency still uses AWS SDK V1 under the hood.**
